# Multi-Class-Classification-Pipeline-for-Diabetes-and-CIFAR10
We create multi-class classification model on Pima Diabetes and CIFAR10 datasets. We will try with several models using the below algorithms and compare the results. Also we could do hyperparameter tuning to acheive the optimal results.

Logistic Regression
Linear Discriminant Analysis
k-Nearest Neighbors
Classification and Regression Trees
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines
